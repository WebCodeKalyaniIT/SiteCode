				<h1>Web Intelligence </h1>
				Web Intelligence is part of SAP BusinessObjects product suite used for analytical and ad hoc reporting to meet an organization’s business requirements. Web Intelligence is a Business Intelligence reporting tool for business users to analyze data in Data Warehouse. It assists business managers in the decision-making process for building future strategies. Using Web Intelligence, business users can create basic, medium, and complex reports from transactional data in database and by creating Universes using Information Design Tool/UDT. Various SAP and non-SAP data sources can be used to create reports in Web Intelligence. SAP Business Warehouse (BW) system doesn’t require a Universe to connect to Web Intelligence tool. Web Intelligence tool can work as a client tool of BusinessObjects platform and also as a standalone tool for reporting.

								<br><br>
								<h4 class="service-heading">Design Studio </h4>
								
								<p>Design Studio is the professionally authored dashboarding and application building tool from SAP. It should be used for all such Projects where  delivery of  larger data sets that SAP dashboard does not perform well with. It has its own server side processing engine and all of its output is HTML5 which means it is automatically mobile ready. Additionally, APOS has a Data Gateway that allows you to connect to additional data sources with added data volume potential. And finally, with the imminent release of Design Studio 1.5 we also plan to add parallel query processing.</p>
									
									
									<h4 class="service-heading">Lumira </h4>
									
									<p>SAP Lumira is a self-service solution that allows analysts and decision makers to access, transform, and visualize data. With Lumira, business analysts can connect to multiple data sources, mash the data together, massage and manipulate it, create beautiful visualizations and stories that they can then share via either on-premise or cloud based platforms. Lumira is the tool when it comes to Data exploring and visualizations.
Lumira lets business users take the advantage of the fun, intuitive and innovative capabilities of Lumira while providing IT with the security and governance needed in an enterprise deployment of data discovery. We call this Trusted Data Discovery. Along with this new deployment option you can also expect to see new features like a new Universe query panel for .unx universes, a new cross-table for OLAP-like data analysis, new interaction capabilities with info-graphics, and updates to the ways that you can use our integrated ESRI geospatial capabilities.

</p><br><br>
									<h4 class="service-heading">Direct Data Connector</h4>
									<p>The Direct Data Connector lets you connect to any relational database using either of the following connection types:</p>
									<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
									<li>Dynamic connection - sending a SQL statement of your construction or choice to the database</li>
									<li>Stored Query connnection - using a pre-configured query with parameters</li>
									</ul><br><br>
									<p>The Direct Data Connector lets you acquire any data from any relational database and use aggregate queries to speed data acquisition.</p>
									<br><br>
									<h4 class="service-heading">APOS Data Gateway Server</h4>
