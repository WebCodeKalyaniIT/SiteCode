				<h1>Web Intelligence </h1>
				Web Intelligence is part of SAP BusinessObjects product suite used for analytical and ad hoc reporting to meet an organization’s business requirements. Web Intelligence is a Business Intelligence reporting tool for business users to analyze data in Data Warehouse. It assists business managers in the decision-making process for building future strategies. Using Web Intelligence, business users can create basic, medium, and complex reports from transactional data in database and by creating Universes using Information Design Tool/UDT. Various SAP and non-SAP data sources can be used to create reports in Web Intelligence. SAP Business Warehouse (BW) system doesn’t require a Universe to connect to Web Intelligence tool. Web Intelligence tool can work as a client tool of BusinessObjects platform and also as a standalone tool for reporting.

								<h4 class="service-heading">Business and IT leaders across industries are constantly searching for new and innovative ways to service and delight customers.
Succeeding in this environment requires:
</h4>
								<br>
								<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
									<li>A customer-centric view that focuses on the customer experience through the full engagement cycle</li>
									<li>A distributed manufacturing process that leverages technologies such as automation, 3D printing, and robotics to address the “segment of one”</li>
									<li>A networked economy of assets, manufacturing, logistics, partners, and, of course, people</li>
									<li>A recognition of urbanization as a reality that requires smarter cities, smarter infrastructures, and smarter usage of natural resources

</li>
									</ul><br>
<p>For organizations to achieve these goals, they must embrace the latest technologies to identify new business processes and innovate new business models.
As Ronald van Loon (@Ronald_vanLoon), an expert in the IoT space recently stated, “the Internet of Things is no longer approaching, it is already here. From wearables to trains, they are all connected and capable of delivering new insights on how we interact with machines.”
So what is the Internet of Things(IoT):
The vast network of devices connected to the internet, including the smart phones, tablets and almost anything with a sensor on it, cars, machines in production plants, wearable devices and much more.
All these devices Connect, Collect and can be configured to meet your requirements.
The massive number of connected things and the explosion of data generated by connected Internet of Things-enabled devices will change the way we create these new business models.
With the emergence of smart products, assets, and always-on “things,” we now have access to unparalleled amounts of information. This – along with the evolution of connectivity, big data, analytics, and cloud technology – is enabling us to converge these operational and information technologies to make machines smarter and drive end-to-end digital transformation.
The journey a company takes to get from “things” to “outcomes” is becoming a chief catalyst for digitalization.
</p>
									<h2 class="section-heading">What is SAP Leonardo?</h2><br> 
									<p>The SAP Leonardo portfolio empowers Live Business by connecting the emerging world of intelligent devices with people and processes to achieve tangible business outcomes.
The solutions enable companies to not only realize the digital transformation of existing end-to-end business processes but also evolve new business models to run digitally and create new work environments.

</p>
									<h2 class="section-heading">SAP Leonardo for Health Care</h2><br>
									<p><b><i>Sickness </b></i>:   IoT services obviously have a variety of applications in relation to medical monitoring, but these are often applied in response to medical events and conditions. In contrast, Social Protection aims to reduce exposure to medical risks through proactive and early interventions. IoT services, delivered via wearable technologies, can assist in reducing susceptibility to sickness through risk awareness and promotion of healthy lifestyle choices.</p>
									<br>
									<p><b><i>Disability </b></i>: IoT services are being integrated into assistive devices in a variety of innovative ways to improve quality of life for people with disability. For example, connected wheelchairs can call for assistance in the event of a tip-over or medical emergency and can proactively advise of the need for maintenance or repair. Virtual assistants can also be integrated into the wheelchair to help people with routine tasks, as well as providing a channel for social interaction.</p>
									<p><b><i>Old Age </b></i>:IoT services can assist people to maintain their independence into old age, and help people to live with age-related conditions such as dementia. Given the choice, most people would prefer to remain at home with in-home supports than relocate to an aged care facility. IoT services, delivered via wearables and connected homes, can extend the time in which elderly people can safely live at home, thereby extending their independence and improving quality of life.
